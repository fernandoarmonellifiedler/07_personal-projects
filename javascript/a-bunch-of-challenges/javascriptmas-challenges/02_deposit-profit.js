/* Deposit Profit
Find out how long it would take for your balance to pass a specific threshold with the assumption that you donÂ´t make any additional deposits.
For:

deposit = 100
rate = 20
threshold = 170

the output should be 3

If each year the amount of money increases 20%
year 0 = 100
year 1 = 120
year 2 = 144
year 3 = 172,8

that means that it will take 3 years for your balance topass the threshold wich is the answer.
