/* Test your agility

Make a counter that increments every 75 milliseconds in the spin() function and display whether the player wins or loses in the stop() function

Hints:
- Be sure to use the sleep() function that already exist
- Show the player the numbers with .innerHTML
- DonÂ´t forget, var pushed is defined globally and changes to true after the STOP button is pushed
